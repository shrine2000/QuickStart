# QuickStart CLI

A CLI tool for quickly initializing new projects with a README and .gitignore file. It also sets up a Git repository and opens the project in Visual Studio Code. An incomplete go implemenation can be found [here](https://github.com/shrine2000/QS).

## Usage

1. Install the CLI tool:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

2. Initialize a new project:
    ```bash
    qs PROJECT_NAME FOLDER
    ```

Replace `PROJECT_NAME` with the name of your project and `FOLDER` with the directory where you want to create the project.
