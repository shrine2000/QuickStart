# QuickStart

Instantly create new project folders with Git automatically installed. It also adds licenses, readme files, and commits the first version automatically to GitHub.

**Note:** This is just an MVP. It assumes that Git is installed on the user's system and connected to a Git provider. Apart from the "New Project" feature, other sections are broken and under development.
